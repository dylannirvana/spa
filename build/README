Application production builds can go in this directory. To build your
application for staging or production run this command:

> iron build

This application uses Iron Meteor with Mongo to scaffold
Single Page Applications entirely on Node. This version uses SASS
and JavaScript. Subsequent versions will use CoffeeScript and
other libraries.

What I hope to achieve is an extensible modular application, with
clear design patterns in an IdevE, full-stack isomorphic JavaScript,
that provides at least as much functionality as the other
applications, but without being so bombastic.
